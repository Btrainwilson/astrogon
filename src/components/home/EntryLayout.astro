  description: 'Physics-inspired generative modeling leverages principles from statistical mechanics, electromagnetism, and other physical theories to build efficient and interpretable probabilistic models. By explicitly incorporating physical symmetries, constraints, and known laws into generative models, we significantly reduce the complexity and dimensionality of the learning problem. This approach enables accurate data generation, improved generalization, and deeper insights into underlying physical processes, making it especially powerful for applications in simulation, material science, and system prediction.',
