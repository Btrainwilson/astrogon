- [ ] Clean up Docs flex structure in cases of DocBrowser or ToC absence, and bound the width of blog.
- [ ] Either clean up and tame the shortcodes, or replace them with ones from other templates.
- [ ] Create a component that puts an image on the left and text on the right and vice-versa for Advynt prep? Alt: make a component that blurs on hover when flavor text is provided, revealing that text. Then the image can go above the text, which itself could be divided into tabs.
