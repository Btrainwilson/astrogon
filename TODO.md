# TO DO

- [x] Make the search work across collection types
- [x] Make search check content in addition to title, category, and tag
- [x] Structure Docs folder pages to be visually appealing
- [x] Centralize customizable items to enable more rapid personalization of the template
- [x] Create explicit types across the app
- [x] Prep for upgrade to Astro v5
- [x] Tighten up the Blog post browser
- [x] Make everything turn to glass in an instant
- [x] Add border/shadow functionality to glass panes
- [x] Formalize existing documentation
- [x] Make uniform the page/layout/component structure across the project
- [x] Parametrize (in config) pagination, related posts count on BlogSingle and AuthorSingle
- [x] Import the recipes collection from `origin/develop`, update it accordingly
- [x] Create a new collection for poetry style content.
- [x] Untangle the mess that is DocBrowser
- [x] Make Docs browser bold on the current doc
- [ ] Add images to docCards, build their style around that
- [ ] Add in a bunch of stock content so the might of the template is more apparent
- [ ] Make it so Authors searches all colections for potential authors, not just the blog.
- [ ] Make it so across the site, authors hyperlink only if they have a page to link to.
- [ ] Either clean up and tame the shortcodes, or replace them with ones from other templates.
- [ ] Make a Customization Quickstart guide, to explain the most significant areas of interest
- [ ] Tighten up the CSS/Tailwind Config pipeline
- [ ] Make Docs table of contents bold on the current heading?
- [ ] Create a component that puts an image on the left and text on the right and vice-versa for Advynt prep
- [ ] We might want an "opaque glass" component that has translucency and contrast on glass, but turns opaque instead of transparent on "no-glass" mode. It's only relevant in a few places.
